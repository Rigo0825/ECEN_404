Description:

This was the third lab for ECEN-404. This was the week of the Career Fair and our first presentation update. On Tuesday I drove out to A&M's observatory and
met with Don, our customer and I discussed with him various design considerations we proceed with respect to the shell and methods by which it is 
secured to the telescope (via standardized female M42 threading). Don recommended me to use a female TPO M42 10mm spacer extension which will need to attach
to the shell. Our options are to purchase and gut an existing astronomy/telescope device, or manufacture our own polymer shell, likely dremeling a hole
and attached the threading with some binding agent/glue.
Max Lesser, our sponsor/TA, was CC'd in my email exchange with Don.

Current Issues for my Subsystem:
Photometer shell considerations (WRT best methods and practices to securely fashion a metal female m42 threading to a polymer housing unit), Light Path and Securing of photodiode
within the shell, and Integration considerations with Richard's subsystem (PCB vs Protoboard; his system reads my voltage and sends 2bit signal to MUX)

Newly Discovered Problems:
-Out of an abundance of caution, I am testing our previously purchased photodiodes with a known, legitimate S-1087-01 photodiode in order to verify 
expected behaviors
-Given the extreme temperatures the observatory can reach more 

Solutions:
Research and discuss progress with shell, as well, keep our customer and TA updated with issues encountered

Short-term Milestones:
Meeting with Don was very productive and we learned exactly what parts we need to secure, as well, Don is providing to us a legitimate 
S-1087-01 photodiode and also clarified a misunderstanding we had about how Integration is measured
