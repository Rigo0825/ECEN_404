Description:

This was the seventh lab for ECEN-404. 

Current Issues for my Subsystem:
Lightpath is still a consideration

Newly Discovered Problems:
Waiting for epoxy to harden

Solutions:
Consider Lightpath solutions and research how JBweld epoxy can best be usde

Short-term Milestones:
I assisted Rigo and Richard with designing their PCB. 
JB Weld and superglue have proven to be effective plastic-metal binding agents between M42 metal spacer ring and plastic enclosure
