Description:

This was the sixth lab for ECEN-404. 

Current Issues for my Subsystem:
PCB is slightly larger than anticipated and I may need to scale my enclosure up in the length dimension. Width dimension appears to be a very good fit.

Newly Discovered Problems:
PCB designs fit but considerations will have to be made to have to allow a secure photodiode location with current enclosure dimensions

Solutions:
Consider purchasing and shipping a corrected plastic enclosure

Short-term Milestones:
I assisted Rigo and Richard with designing their PCB. 
JB Weld and superglue have proven to be effective plastic-metal binding agents between M42 metal spacer ring and plastic enclosure
