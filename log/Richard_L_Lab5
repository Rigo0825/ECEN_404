This lab we discussed what progress we did

We are a little behind due to the pcb still being created and placing everything

Issues:
Was missing ground ports and power ports as well as photodiode implementation

Goals by the end of this lab
Desolder the ADC in order to test for SPI in the upcoming weeks

Goals by the next week:
Finish up the PCB and order a pcb and also get Hunter a measurement of the PCB for the chasis
