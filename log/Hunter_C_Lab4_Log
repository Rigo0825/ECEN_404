Description:

This was the fourth lab for ECEN-404. 

Current Issues for my Subsystem:
Photometer shell considerations have been resolved, Light Path and Securing of photodiode within the shell are next to consider,
and Integration considerations with Richard's subsystem (PCB vs Protoboard; his system reads my voltage and sends 2bit signal to MUX) remain

Newly Discovered Problems:
I have a prototype M42 spacer ring and prototype plastic enclosure but the finalized products are being shipped

Solutions:
Research and discuss progress with shell, as well, keep our customer and TA updated with issues encountered

Short-term Milestones:
I have received a legitimate photodiode from Don to test and enclosure is being shipped
