Current Issues:
PCB design, Parts procurement, Chasis design, Light Path/Securing of photodiode, and Integration considerations (PCB vs Protoboard)

Newly Discovered Problems:
Learning curves associated with Chasis design

Solutions:
Discuss issues with TA 

Short-term Milestones:
Familiarize with options to design device chassis and light path/securement
