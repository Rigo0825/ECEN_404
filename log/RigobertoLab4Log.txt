Description:
Fourth lab meeting of the semester, I will discuss my current progress and issues
with the TA and work on progressing with the project.

Current Issues:
Cannot implement interrups together with UART. MCC implemented interrups can not handle
more than one action per interrupt.

Newly Discovered Problems:
Need to provide -5V to Hunter's system.

Solutions:
Either implement desing sequentially or find more resources to implement interrupts from scratch.

Short-term Milestones:
Find alternate resources to implement interrupts
Finish power supply Altium design
Continue working on software integration
