Description:
Ninth lab meeting of the semester, I will discuss my current progress and issues
with the TA and work on progressing with the project. Our photometer now has a working
ADC. This ADC has been tested to ensure it works in the correct range of voltage inputs.

Current Issues:
Photodiode is not outputing the correct voltage values, we must debug the system.

Newly Discovered Problems:
More unconnected PCB traces were found. This should be a fixable issue.

Solutions:
Debug Photodiode system using a multimeter.

Short-term Milestones:
Debug the Photodiode.
