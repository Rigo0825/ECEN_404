Description:
Eighth lab meeting of the semester, I will discuss my current progress and issues
with the TA and work on progressing with the project. Our photometer now has a working
display. This display has been tested to ensure it works in the correct range of values.

Current Issues:
My partern's ADC is still not working, I will have to take over his system and debug it.

Newly Discovered Problems:
PCB has some traces that are not connected from one layer to the other. This seems to be
a manufacturing error.

Solutions:
Dedicate time to getting the ADC to work. Short traces from one layer of the PCB to the ohter
using wires.

Short-term Milestones:
Debug the ADC using an oscilloscope.
